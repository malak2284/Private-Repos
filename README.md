# Distributed Dictionary Translation System

![Banner](https://dummyimage.com/1200x300/333/fff&text=Distributed+Dictionary+Translation+System)

Welcome to the **Distributed Dictionary Translation System** repository! This project is a sophisticated Java-based application that demonstrates a distributed architecture for real-time word translation. With multiple language servers working together and a user-friendly GUI client, this system is an impressive showcase of network programming, concurrency, and dynamic server management.

  - [GUI Client](#gui-client)
- [How It Works](#how-it-works)


## Overview
This project implements a distributed dictionary system where a **Main Server** handles client connections and delegates translation requests to dedicated **Language Servers**. Managed centrally by the **Dictionary Servers Manager**, these components work together seamlessly to provide a smooth translation experience via both a command-line interface and an interactive GUI built with Swing.

## Architecture
- **Main Server:**  
  Listens for incoming client connections on port `8000` and dispatches requests using a fixed thread pool.
  
- **Language Servers:**  
  Each server listens on its designated port (e.g., `9001` for English, `9002` for French, `9003` for German) and processes translation requests for a specific language.
  
- **Dictionary Servers Manager:**  
  Initializes default language servers, manages them, and allows for dynamic additions of new language servers.
  
- **Client Handler:**  
  Parses incoming client requests, determines the appropriate language server, and routes the request for translation.
  
- **GUI Client:**  
  Provides an intuitive Swing-based interface for users to input words, select the target language, and view translations in real time.

## Features

### Main Server
- **Concurrent Client Handling:**  
  Efficiently manages multiple client connections using a fixed thread pool.
- **Centralized Routing:**  
  Delegates translation requests to the correct language server based on user input.

### Language Servers
- **Dedicated Language Processing:**  
  Each server is responsible for a specific language, ensuring tailored translation logic.
- **Scalable and Extendable:**  
  Easily add new language servers as needed to support additional languages.

### Dictionary Servers Manager
- **Dynamic Initialization:**  
  Automatically starts default language servers and supports the integration of new ones.
- **Centralized Management:**  
  Maintains and provides information on all active language servers.

### Client Handler
- **Robust Request Parsing:**  
  Validates and processes client input, ensuring correct routing to language servers.
- **Reliable Communication:**  
  Bridges the gap between the client and the appropriate language server efficiently.

### GUI Client
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Built with Swing, offering a responsive and engaging experience.
- **Real-Time Translation:**  
  Enter a word, select a language, and get immediate translation feedback.
- **Interactive and Intuitive:**  
  Designed to impress with its clean layout and ease of use.

## How It Works
1. **Server Initialization:**  
   The Main Server starts on port `8000`, initializing a thread pool and the Dictionary Servers Manager, which in turn launches default Language Servers.
2. **Client Request:**  
   A client (via command line or GUI) sends a translation request formatted as `word,languageCode`.
3. **Request Processing:**  
   The Client Handler parses the request and uses the Dictionary Servers Manager to locate the appropriate Language Server.
4. **Translation:**  
   The Language Server processes the word, applies the translation logic (currently simplified), and returns the translated word.
5. **Response Display:**  
   The client receives the translation and displays it, providing a smooth, interactive experience.
