  - [Language Servers](#language-servers)
  - [Dictionary Servers Manager](#dictionary-servers-manager)
  - [Client Handler](#client-handler)
  - [GUI Client](#gui-client)
- [How It Works](#how-it-works)


## Overview
This project implements a distributed dictionary system where a **Main Server** handles client connections and delegates translation requests to dedicated **Language Servers**. Managed centrally by the **Dictionary Servers Manager**, these components work together seamlessly to provide a smooth translation experience via both a command-line interface and an interactive GUI built with Swing.

## Architecture
- **Main Server:**  
  Listens for incoming client connections on port `8000` and dispatches requests using a fixed thread pool.
  
- **Language Servers:**  
  Each server listens on its designated port (e.g., `9001` for English, `9002` for French, `9003` for German) and processes translation requests for a specific language.
  
- **Dictionary Servers Manager:**  
  Initializes default language servers, manages them, and allows for dynamic additions of new language servers.
  
- **Client Handler:**  
  Parses incoming client requests, determines the appropriate language server, and routes the request for translation.
  
- **GUI Client:**  
  Provides an intuitive Swing-based interface for users to input words, select the target language, and view translations in real time.

## Features

### Main Server
- **Concurrent Client Handling:**  
  Efficiently manages multiple client connections using a fixed thread pool.
- **Centralized Routing:**  
  Delegates translation requests to the correct language server based on user input.

### Language Servers
- **Dedicated Language Processing:**  
  Each server is responsible for a specific language, ensuring tailored translation logic.
- **Scalable and Extendable:**  
  Easily add new language servers as needed to support additional languages.

### Dictionary Servers Manager
- **Dynamic Initialization:**  
  Automatically starts default language servers and supports the integration of new ones.
- **Centralized Management:**  
  Maintains and provides information on all active language servers.

### Client Handler
- **Robust Request Parsing:**  
  Validates and processes client input, ensuring correct routing to language servers.
- **Reliable Communication:**  
  Bridges the gap between the client and the appropriate language server efficiently.

### GUI Client
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Built with Swing, offering a responsive and engaging experience.
- **Real-Time Translation:**  
  Enter a word, select a language, and get immediate translation feedback.
- **Interactive and Intuitive:**  
  Designed to impress with its clean layout and ease of use.

## How It Works
1. **Server Initialization:**  
   The Main Server starts on port `8000`, initializing a thread pool and the Dictionary Servers Manager, which in turn launches default Language Servers.
2. **Client Request:**  
   A client (via command line or GUI) sends a translation request formatted as `word,languageCode`.
3. **Request Processing:**  
   The Client Handler parses the request and uses the Dictionary Servers Manager to locate the appropriate Language Server.
4. **Translation:**  
   The Language Server processes the word, applies the translation logic (currently simplified), and returns the translated word.
5. **Response Display:**  
   The client receives the translation and displays it, providing a smooth, interactive experience.

- [Features](#features)
- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [How It Works](#how-it-works)


## Overview
This project reads travel offer data from text files, processes and localizes the information (supporting multiple locales and date formats), and then stores it in a MySQL database. Users can interact with the system via a responsive Swing GUI to view offers, filter by language and date format, and get real-time updates. The solution is designed to be both functional and appealingâ€”ideal for real-world travel agencies or as a proof-of-concept for scalable Java applications.

## Features
- **Database Creation & Management:**  
  Automatically creates a MySQL table to store travel offers and populates it with data read from files.
  
- **Data Parsing & Localization:**  
  Processes raw travel data, localizes country names and travel details based on user-selected locale (e.g., `pl_PL`, `en_GB`), and formats dates according to user preferences.
  
- **Interactive GUI:**  
  A user-friendly Swing interface lets users select language and date format options, then displays travel offers in an interactive table.
  
- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  The system is built to gracefully handle parsing errors and SQL exceptions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Architecture
- **Database Class:**  
  Handles MySQL connection, table creation, and data insertion.
  
- **TravelData Class:**  
  Reads and formats travel offer data from external files, supporting dynamic localization using resource bundles.
  
- **Main Class:**  
  Serves as the entry point, demonstrating both console output and the launch of the graphical user interface.
  
- **GUI Implementation:**  
  Utilizes Java Swing components to provide an intuitive interface for viewing and filtering travel offers.

## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   The application reads raw travel offer data from files located in a designated `data` directory.
2. **Data Processing:**  
   Offers are parsed and localized according to the selected language and date format. Country names and places are translated using resource bundles.
3. **Database Population:**  
   A MySQL database is automatically set up with a dedicated table (`offers`), and all parsed travel offers are inserted into it.
4. **Interactive Display:**  
   A Swing GUI allows users to choose language and date format options, and displays the travel offers in a responsive table view.









# Interactive NIO Communication System

![NIO Communication](https://dummyimage.com/1200x300/333/fff&text=Interactive+NIO+Communication+System)

Welcome to the **Interactive NIO Communication System** repository! This project showcases an advanced Java application that combines non-blocking network communication using Java NIO with intuitive Swing-based graphical interfaces. Designed with real-time messaging, topic subscriptions, and dynamic administration in mind, this system demonstrates my expertise in concurrent programming, network protocols, and user interface design.

**Repository:** [CODE](https://github.com/malak2284/Interactive-NIO-Communication-System)

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Features](#features)
- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [How It Works](#how-it-works)


## Overview
This project implements a multi-faceted communication system where clients and administrators connect to a central server using non-blocking I/O (Java NIO). The system includes:
- **Client and Admin Applications:**  
  Both provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to interact with the server. Clients can manage topics and send messages, while admins can view and control active topics.
- **Server Components:**  
  A robust server (with a dedicated GUI) listens for incoming connections, manages topic-based subscriptions, and forwards messages accordingly. Additionally, a basic echo server is implemented for demonstration purposes.

## Features
- **Non-Blocking Communication:**  
  Utilizes Java NIO with SocketChannels and Selectors to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Graphical User Interfaces:**  
  Developed using Swing, offering separate GUIs for Clients, Admins, and the Server, each tailored for their respective tasks.
- **Topic Management:**  
  Clients can add or remove topics dynamically, while the server supports topic-based subscriptions to filter and forward messages.
- **Interactive and Real-Time:**  
  Immediate feedback and message forwarding provide a responsive, real-time communication experience.
- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Gracefully handles connection issues, ensuring stable communication between clients and the server.

## Architecture
- **Client & Admin Applications:**  
  Both applications establish non-blocking connections to the server (port 12345) and provide interactive GUIs for sending and receiving messages. The Admin interface also aggregates topics from the Client GUI for enhanced management.
  
- **ServerGUI:**  
  Implements a non-blocking server using a Selector to monitor multiple channels. It manages client subscriptions, logs activity in a Swing-based interface, and forwards messages to subscribers based on topic matching.
  
- **Server (Echo Server):**  
  A simpler server implementation (listening on port 12346) that echoes incoming messages. This component demonstrates fundamental NIO operations and serves as a test bed for network communication.

## How It Works
1. **Connection Establishment:**  
   - Clients and Admins create non-blocking SocketChannels and connect to the ServerGUI.
   - The server registers new client connections using a Selector for efficient I/O operations.

2. **Messaging & Topic Subscription:**  
   - Clients can add topics through their GUI. These topics are displayed dynamically and can be used to filter messages.
   - Admins access a dedicated interface to view and manage these topics.
   - The server monitors incoming messages; if a message includes a subscribed topic, it is forwarded to the relevant clients.

3. **Interactive Communication:**  
   - All components use Swing to offer real-time feedback. Messages and status updates appear instantly on the respective GUIs, ensuring a smooth, interactive experience.
